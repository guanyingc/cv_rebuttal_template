# Rebuttal Template for CV Conference

This repo provides two LaTex templates for preparing the rebuttal for CV conferences (e.g., CVPR/ICCV).

Overleaf Link: https://www.overleaf.com/read/wqhjmsbhdrxp.

## Example 1
This template groups the responses for each reviewer. It is useful when different reviewers have different questions, and there are many small questions to answer for each reviewer.
